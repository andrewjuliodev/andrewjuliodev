### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my Github profile! 

I am Andrew and currently working on building up my Frontend Portfolio specialising in React & Vue down the road.

As of 29 August 2021, I have begun the #100DaysOfCode challenge using the designs provided by FrontendMentor.io (FEM) solely making use of Vanilla CSS & JavaScript.

FEM provides free projects with designs including the images and links to the fonts, just like a designer would provide the developers, and hence a great way to practice what I have learnt, whilst gaining a deeper knowledge of the respective technologies involved.

Being creative is one of my passions, ranging from cooking to making jewellery or anything else really. Life is a challenge and it's always better when one chooses their own challenges and discovers new depths of understanding and motivation while better preparing for the unknown!

Feel free to browse my work, check out my [Website](http://andrewjulio.com):man_technologist: and to contact me here on Github or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Andrew):slightly_smiling_face:
